# OH GOD WHY!?
It is currently 10:45 PM 11/9/2025

I just added a new feature on Anita-chan, the uhh, custom form feature. It's cool, I guess, kinda, maybe. I kinda like it...

But anyway, I decided to write this as a lesson for myself and anyone else that might bother reading. A lesson of passion, spite, and oh god why did I do that!?

# It All Started With An AI Hype

An acquaintance showed me this thing... I think it's something called vercel zero? You know one of those AI website builder. It's the peak of AI Gold Rush, yknow, around the same time Deepseek gets released and tanked Nvidia's stock, remember that??? But anyway, yeah, I got curious and try it out.

On a very meta-fashion, I decided to ask one of these AI Website Creator tool to create a simple AI Website creator, you know, like Deepsite.

It works! Perfectly!!! And you know what?! I kinda dig it~

Then I tried maintaining it...

# Skill Issue???

Look, back then I have zero knowledge in dealing with JS Framework (even now I still suck at it), so like... Eh, guess it's just a skill issue on my part that I don't understand a single line of code this AI Website Builder spits out.

Anyway, you can find the result here: https://github.com/Iteranya/Aina-Website-Builder 

It's 100% AI Generated, and yes it's archived for a reason~

# Discord Bot EVERYTHING!!!!

If you don't know anything about me, is that I really, really like Discord Bot. I mean, at this point, Discord is basically my home, so like...

Hey, let's make a Discord, a silly discord bot, that lets you enter website description through a Slash Command. It will the automatically create a website you can access through a cloudflare tunnel. Cool stuff! Really~ I really like it.

And then I decided to create a simple UI for it.

And...

Umm...

It took me... an hour... manual coding discord bot

And another hour of prompting AI to make the UI after I added the routes and such.

...

And the code was smol.

# WAS IT SKILL ISSUE!?!?!?

I revisited the AI Generated Code and found that it is... How do I say this, uhh...

A sophisticated mess...

Like, seriously, it's sophisticated, VERY SOPHISTICATED

***but it's a fuckin mess***

And FUCK THAT, seriously, WHAT THE FUCK!?!?!? All this time I could've just code like a normal person!?!?

So from that, a brand new iteration of Aina is born: https://github.com/Iteranya/Aina-Website-Creator

This is the REAL Website Creator

# Now where else can I take this???

So after making this, I decided to see if I can make a super simple CMS, you know, to like... After making the website creator, put it in a smol database, and then a small admin page to like, manage the AI Generated site.

And at this point too I've been having dreams of a certain bnnuy from Arknight and decieded screw it...

https://github.com/Iteranya/Amiya-CMS

SHE'S CUTE ***FIGHT ME***

Ahem, but anyway, for this 'CMS' I decided to use FastAPI and TinyDB as my database.

And... yknow, it's functional

But after I consulted with expert (ChatGPT), it's still, well, terrible in all sorts of ways.

Like, TinyDB is not built for database, and it has *zero* security.

So I shelf this project...

# Enter, ASTA

Asta is a Markdown Editor I made to help me write my thesis. It supposed to be you know, capable of being transpiled into Latex and then sent to yknow...Overleaf.

*It did not go well*

I mean, look, there's Latex libraries, and there's like different components from different libraries and like...

I know when it's impossible, okay??? And besides people would prefer to just have an AI Powered Latex Editor than having to mess around with Markdown Anyway...

And you know what!? Fuck that!!! I still have an AI Powered Markdown Editor yay me, WOOOO!!!!


# Wordpress My Old Enemy...

At first, I was going to like, move on to another project. But one thing led to another, and I found myself dealing with Wordpress, again.

And I'm like...

## AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

WHY THE FUCK DO I HAVE TO PAY 20$ A MONTH TO CHANGE THE EDIT THE FUCKING HEADER?!?!?!?! WHAT KIND OF ECOSYSTEM IS THIS!? JESUS FUCKING CHRIST FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!

Ahem... And during that uhh... Epiphany, I decided that if no one else gonna do it, I am going to do it. I am going to create a replacement for Wordpress that is better in everyway and have ***absolutely no paywalls***


# Amiya, Aina, and Asta walk into a codebase

I looked at my HTML Generator (Aina), my simple CMS (Amiya), and my Markdown Editor (Asta)

And with their help, I began project Anita...

The vision is simple. Use AI to make a website and use the Admin Page to seamlessly and easily manage everything.

You can use the AI to make HTML site or you use AI to make the Markdown Powered Blog Site.

And unlike most 'AI WEBSITE BUILDER', this one got none of those hands free stuff.

You know exactly what the AI makes at every moment. You deal with your own backend, and you are urged to deal with it.

"But Artes Iteranya!!" I hear you howling. "How is that better than Wordpress??"

BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY SHIT AND THE CODEBASE IS SMALLER THAN YOUR FUCKING NODE JS DUMPSTER FIRE!!!

Ahem, I mean...

I designed this CMS to be infinitely hackable. Yes, the Front End Scripts are... how do I say this, still vibe coded. But the foundation, the FastAPI and Database and Security is solid-ish.

# Creating An Invisible Framework

You know stuff like Ruby On Rails? Yeah, Anita is similar. It works out of the box, you need minimal coding to get your first website running. Hell, with the brand new custom home feature, you can create a portfolio website without touching the IDE.

However, unlike most framework, Anita is very transparent. It's brain dead simple because the developer is also brain dead simple minded.

There's only one user, admin, because if you need multiple admin to manage your site, you probably want something better.

Or better yet, you can actually hack this thing!!! Create something that is more enterprise ready! WOOO!!!

(Ah, also, A-GPL-3 License, so you need to share that too~ :3)

Edit: Added RBAC, I need a life, Anita now has ABAC, RBAC, and that label object thing. Why am I doing this to myself?

# React? Svelte?

NEVER!!!

Alpine + HTMX is all I need. Fuck NodeJS. ***I hate magic***

The only front end debugging tool I need and ever want is Right Click, View Page Source and Inspect Element. 

AS GOD INTENDED

YOU THINK OBFUSCATION DOES SHIT TOWARDS YOUR SITE SECURITY?!?!?

BOTS DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT OBFUSCATION, THEY SEE CVE REPORT AND START SPAMMING THE WHOLE GODDAMN INTERNET!!!!

...

Ahem, anyway...

That is all, thank you

# EDIT: THE AI REMOVAL UPDATE

HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! I DID IT I FUCKING DID IT!!!

NO MORE AI!!! FUCK YOU ALLL!!!!!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

I have integrated Aina with Ace Editor, do some funky metaprogramming, and created PLUGINS, that you can just CLICK inside the...

*drumroll*

**Aina Server Integrated Development Environment!!!**

You go to Aina, you got three tabs:

Tab 1: Generator -> You click on selection of data from backend you want to access (auto populates your forms and custom collections and media files)

Tab 2: Editor -> You have an editor to write HTML and Tailwind and Alpine stuff... You also got another editor to write CSS!!!

Tab 3: Setting -> Switches to setup your own CSP Headers and Meta and Head and such!! SECURITY FTW WOOOOO!!!

Also Asta is now Milkdown now, which is nice...

...

NOW STOP USING WORDPRESS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-
