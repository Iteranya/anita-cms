**ANITA CMS** is the lovechild of three powerful projects - combining Amiya's simplicity, Aina's AI website generation, and Asta's markdown superpowers into one delightful CMS. No bloated frameworks, no Node.js nonsense - just pure vanilla JS magic with a FastAPI backend and SQLite database.

## 🌈 Why ANITA?

### For The Underpaid Heroes
- **$20 Website Warriors**: When clients pay in exposure bucks but demand production quality
- **Interns Needing Wins**: Quick portfolio pieces that don't look like Geocities throwbacks
- **0.5 Developer Teams**: Full-time responsibilities, half-time budget, zero-time patience for bloat

### For The Vanilla Purists
- **Node.js Allergy Sufferers**: Who break out in hives at `npm install`
- **"Just Give Me Plain JS"** Crowd: Who want modern features without framework lock-in
- **Build-Your-Own-Adventure** Devs: Tiny core you can extend without fighting someone else's abstractions

### For The Time-Pressed
- **"Need It Yesterday"** Clients: Who think "simple blog" means "launch in 20 minutes"
- **Landing Page Mercenaries**: Who get paid per conversion, not per hour spent configuring
- **"Make It Pop"** Designers: Who want AI-generated wow factor without touching DevTools

### Secret Bonus
- **Codebase Smaller Than**:
  - Your average `node_modules` folder
  - A single React component's dependency tree  
  - The CSS for most "lightweight" frameworks
- **Hackable Core**: The opposite of "magic" frameworks - you can actually understand AND modify everything
