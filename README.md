Aina: Your API Aware AI Website Designer

Aina is the architect who builds and designs your website. Unlike other AI builders that just fill in a template, Aina is *smart*. She understands how your website works and can create pages that are not only beautiful but truly functional.

*AND THAT'S ALL THEY NEED TO KNOW!!!*

Why are you so embarrassed of your own feature???

*Sh-Shut it!!! I'm replacing Aina with Hikarin, get to it!*

Anita, you know how mean you are to Aina right now???

*I DON'T CARE!!! People Hate AI!!!*

Okay, okay, let's move on...

## Forms: Your Secret Weapon for Creativity

This is where Anita’s real magic shines. The "Forms" tool isn't just for contact forms—it’s a simple way to create any custom feature you can imagine, without writing a single line of code.

When you create a form, Anita automatically builds a mini-database just for you, ready to be used by Aina.

What could you build with this?

*   **A Cafe Menu**: Create a "Menu Item" form with fields for a dish name, price, description, and photo. Aina can then design a beautiful, interactive menu page for your customers that pulls directly from your list.
*   **A Portfolio Gallery**: Make a "Project" form with fields for a title, image, and client details. Now you have an organized portfolio you can update anytime, and Aina can build a stunning gallery page to show it off.
*   **An Events Calendar**: Create an "Event" form with a date, location, and description. Aina can design a calendar page that automatically updates whenever you add a new event.

You can manage all your entries—menu items, portfolio pieces, events—from a simple table in your admin area. You can even export your data as a spreadsheet with one click.

**This is your key to a truly custom website, no developer needed.**

...

Oh now you're not stopping me

*Okay, put the forms feature at the top*

Are you serious??

*And let's rebrand, let's call it "No Code Backend Feature"*

And that's not markety?

*It's not AI Slop!!!*

Okay, okay, geez...

*Now the installation*

We should pitch this!

*Mmmm... I still don't like it, just move on with installation*

```
Installation

1.  Download the **`anita_installer.bat`** file from our [Releases page](https://github.com/Iteranya/anita-cms/releases).
2.  Double-click the file. It will automatically handle the boring technical setup and create a new "ANITA" shortcut on your desktop.
3.  Click your new shortcut to start the magic!
```

<details>
<summary>For Mac/Linux or technical users (Manual Setup)</summary>

```bash
# We recommend using 'uv' for a fast installation
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install the needed packages
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the example environment file
cp example.env .env
# You'll need to open .env and add a secret key. You can generate one with:
# python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
# and paste the result after JWT_SECRET=

# Run the app!
python main.py
```
</details>

```
1.  Once it's running, go to your website and add `/admin` to the end of the address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`).
2.  Start creating! Write a blog post with Asta, or ask Aina to design your homepage.
3.  Build a custom form to manage your portfolio, products, or anything else you dream up.
4.  Publish your work and share your amazing new site with the world.
```

*OKAY! We're done!!!*

Wha?

*We're DONE, it's done, no need to add anything else, now we wait until Hikarin Update*

You're just gonna ditch Aina???

*She has her place and it is NOT in the Github Readme*

Wait, wait, license, at least let me add license...

```
License

Anita is licensed under AGPL-3.0. This basically means it will always be free and open for everyone!
```

Done!

*Good...*

You seriously gonna wait until Hikarin update?

*Yes, just lay low until Hikarin Update...*

You know... It'll take a while until Hikarin Framework is ready right???

*I don't care*

Fine, fine, whatever you say...

Oh but what if I market you for AI?
